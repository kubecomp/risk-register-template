# Risk Register Template

Includes CSV and XLSX formats with common fields:
- Risk ID, Title, Owner
- Inherent Likelihood/Impact (1–5)
- Controls / Mitigations
- Residual Likelihood/Impact (1–5)
- Treatment, Target Date, Status

## Tips
- Add KRIs (e.g., critical vulns > SLA) and link to Jira tickets.
- Provide quarterly exec summaries: “Top 5 risks, trends, and treatment status.”
- Simple scoring: `Risk Score = Likelihood x Impact` for inherent and residual.
